# 1. IMPORTANT: First, install PyTorch with CUDA support. Go to the
#    official PyTorch website (https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
#    and get the correct command for your system (OS, Package, CUDA Version).
#    The command will look something like this:
#    pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
#
# 2. After PyTorch is installed, install all other packages using this file:
#    pip install -r requirements.txt
